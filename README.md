# What is Bitburner?

[Bitburner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/) is a Free2Play Idle Game. In this you can [program](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.ns.md) your own Bots using JavaScript.

## What have i done

I programed a interface which uses [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to control the Bots. With this setup i am able to graph out my current hack target.

## LuckysLib?

This is a collection of functions that i found were of great use in all of my scripts.

for example:
the getAllServers() function gives access to all the servers without being limited by the game phase

## What do i want to add?

- More control with Node-RED
- Better resource management from the BotManager.js script
